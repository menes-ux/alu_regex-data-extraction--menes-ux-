# Regex Data Extraction WebApp

## Project Overview
This project is part of a formative assignment where I build a web application to extract structured data from large amounts of text using **Regular Expressions (Regex)**.  

The web application is designed to identify and extract common data formats such as:
- Email addresses  
- URLs  
- Phone numbers  
- Credit card numbers  
- Time (12-hour & 24-hour formats)  
- HTML tags  
- Hashtags  
- Currency amounts  

The goal is to create clean, reusable regex patterns and demonstrate their use in a simple web-based interface.
